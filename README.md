# Database Systems: Assignments Solutions
## Spring 2024 (Fast Nuces Lhr)

This repository contains the solutions to the DB assignment questions from my lectures at the Spring 2024 semester at FAST NUCES Lhr. These solutions are intended to help students who are struggling with understanding the concepts and solving the assignments.

_**Note:**_ that these solutions are provided for the theory (subject), not the lab subject. Therefore, they may not be useful for the lab subject. Moreover, [Microsoft SQL Server (Express)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) is being used as main Database Server for Executing SQL Queries. In addition to that, we need a server manager. You can use [Microsoft SQL Server Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) as Server Manager for Executing Queries, but i am using `mssql` extension is VSCode.
